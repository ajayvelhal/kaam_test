I have used getx as a statemanagement because it is well-suited for swift development, smaller to mid-sized applications, and developers who favor a reactive programming approach that minimizes boilerplate code.
BLoC is particularly advantageous for extensive applications requiring a well-organized, testable framework that distinctly separates business logic from presentation concerns.
Riverpod caters to users who prioritize provider-based state management, benefiting from robust static analysis and built-in support for dependency injection.
